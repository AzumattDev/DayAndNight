# Description

## A mod that allows you to change aspects about the day and night within the game. Optionally, freeze time at a specific time of day.

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly, upon file save, it will reflect your changes.`


---

The config file is generated after booting the game with the mod once. You can find it in BepInEx/config/Azumatt.DayAndNight.cfg
I do recommend using the [ConfigurationManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/sunkenland/p/Azumatt/BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/) to change this key bind and other values live while you're in-game.


### Additional Information:

- If you wish to have the day forced on other players, you might have to toggle the Freeze Time option for their client to update when changing the settings live.
- Recommended to only be installed on the host machine, not tested with multiple people having the mod installed.
