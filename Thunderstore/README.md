# Description

## A mod that allows you to change aspects about the day and night within the game. Optionally, freeze time at a specific time of day.

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly, upon file save, it will reflect your changes.`


---

The config file is generated after booting the game with the mod once. You can find it in BepInEx/config/Azumatt.DayAndNight.cfg
I do recommend using the [ConfigurationManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/sunkenland/p/Azumatt/BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/) to change this key bind and other values live while you're in-game.


### Additional Information:

- If you wish to have the day forced on other players, you might have to toggle the Freeze Time option for their client to update when changing the settings live.
- Recommended to only be installed on the host machine, not tested with multiple people having the mod installed.

**Day, Night, and Cycle Length Modifiers: Control The Passage of Time In Your Game**

These settings allow you to tweak the length of day and night cycles in your game to suit your preferences or create new challenges. Hereâ€™s how each setting works:

1. **Day Modifier**:
   - This setting adjusts the length of the in-game daytime.
   - Setting it to 1 keeps the day length normal.
   - A setting of 2 doubles the length of the daytime, making days last twice as long.
   - A setting of 0.5 halves the daytime length, making days pass twice as fast.
   - If set to -1, the day length reverts to the game's default setting.

2. **Night Modifier**:
   - This setting adjusts the length of the in-game nighttime.
   - Setting it to 1 keeps the night length normal.
   - A setting of 2 doubles the length of the nighttime, making nights last twice as long.
   - A setting of 0.5 halves the nighttime length, making nights pass twice as fast.
   - If set to -1, the night length reverts to the game's default setting.

3. **Cycle Length In Minutes**:
   - This setting adjusts the total length of a full day-night cycle in real-time minutes.
   - For instance, setting it to 10 makes a full day-night cycle last 10 minutes in real time.
   - If set to -1, the cycle length reverts to the game's default setting, which is 5 minutes.

These modifiers provide a simple way to control the pace of your game. Whether you want longer days to explore, longer nights to increase the challenge, or faster cycles for a quicker gameplay experience, these settings put the control in your hands.
